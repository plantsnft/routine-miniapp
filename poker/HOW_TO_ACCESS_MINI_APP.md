## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Link doesn't open as mini app"
- Make sure you're using the Farcaster/Warpcast app (not browser)
- Try creating a cast with the URL first, then tapping it
- Check that your Vercel deployment is live and accessible

### "Can't find the mini app"
- Make sure you're using the correct Vercel URL
- Check that the deployment succeeded
- Try the direct URL method first

### "Sign-in still doesn't work"
- Make sure you're accessing via Farcaster/Warpcast app
- Regular browser won't work (by design!)
- Check Vercel logs if there are errors

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Bookmark your Vercel URL** for easy access
2. **Create a test cast** with your URL pinned to your profile
3. **Share with test users** by sending them the cast link
4. **Use Warpcast** - it has better mini app support currently

## 🔗 Your Deployment URL

Once you know your Vercel URL, you can:
- Share it in casts
- Add it to your profile
- Test it directly
- Use it for production

**Example format:**
```
https://poker-xyz123.vercel.app
```

Replace with your actual Vercel deployment URL!
